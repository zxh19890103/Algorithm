            Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent pairs and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list. Although the algorithm is simple, it is too slow and impractical for most problems even when compared to insertion sort.[2] Bubble sort can be practical if the input is in mostly sorted order with some out-of-order elements nearly in position.

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. However, insertion sort provides several advantages:
Simple implementation: Jon Bentley shows a three-line C version, and a five-line optimized version[2]
Efficient for (quite) small data sets, much like other quadratic sorting algorithms
More efficient in practice than most other simple quadratic (i.e., O(n2)) algorithms such as selection sort or bubble sort
Adaptive, i.e., efficient for data sets that are already substantially sorted: the time complexity is O(kn) when each element in the input is no more than k places away from its sorted position
Stable; i.e., does not change the relative order of elements with equal keys
In-place; i.e., only requires a constant amount O(1) of additional memory space
Online; i.e., can sort a list as it receives it

            In computer science, selection sort is a sorting algorithm, specifically an in-place comparison sort. It has O(n2) time complexity, making it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort. Selection sort is noted for its simplicity, and it has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain situations, particularly where auxiliary memory is limited.
